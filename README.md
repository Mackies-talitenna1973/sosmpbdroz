Oh my god, just stumbled outta the theater, my head spinning like those damn flashy lights they use in horror flicks. Wolf Man, what an insane ride. My back's all cricked from that lumpy seat and, ugh, they really need to vacuum under those chairs. Popcorn crumbs EVERYWHERE.

So, there's this scene, right after the guy turns into a wolf — hilarious, like if Gordon Ramsay decided to swap screaming at chefs for flipping tables and howling at the moon. The sheer absurdity, mate. The chaos made me feel like I’d walked into a kitchen disaster during dinner rush, knives flying, everyone yelling nonsensically. 

The theater smelled like old socks, or maybe that was just my neighbor who's determined to make sure oatmeal cookies count as real dinner. > Do you remember that bit where the werewolf had this heart-to-heart with his dog? That made me think of my grandmother’s old poodle, completely irrational, since the only   my granny likes is that ancient B&W   about a goose. Or was it a swan? This flick was nothing like that, far more teeth, less feathered friends. 

Oh, and if you're into gnarly transformation scenes that make your skin crawl, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when you can. But don't forget to actually sit through it, otherwise it's like half-baking bread and expecting a croissant. 

Did I mention the soundtrack? Like a drum circle at Burning Man if everyone was just too high to care about rhythm. The violins didn't scream; they whispered, telling secrets like a whisk trying to negotiate with a chocolate mousse. 

Midway, I was distracted by someone’s phone glowing bright. Reminded me I still owe you to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   we talked about. Don't remember the name, but it's like Wolf Man only less hairy and a lot less growling.

Python? Who cares about python — code here’s like:
```python
spaghetti = werewolf  5
for claw in nightmares:
    howling += soup
```
Honestly, what is even happening anymore?
